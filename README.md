## Summary

The digital clock application was the first I have been able to build on my own. After going through
some courses and tutorials in JavaScript I was motivated to take the next step of spreading my wings 
and creating something from scratch.

This lead me to choosing the digital clock application. I learned how to connect components of JavaScript,
HTML, CSS, and get them all working together smoothly. Using the Date constructor to display the real time 
felt great after putting all the logic together inside of a function. I didn't know how to get the clock to
tick at first, but managed to implement the setInterval function at last. I really enjoyed putting all the 
pieces together and having the final product delivered.
