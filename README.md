## Summary

While building the digital clock application Charles learned how to connect JavaScript,
HTML, CSS, and get them all working together smoothly. Using the Date constructor to display the real-time data
felt great after putting all the logic together inside of a function. I didn't know how to get the clock to
tick at first, but figured out how to implement the setInterval function. He really enjoyed putting all the 
pieces together and having the final product delivered.
